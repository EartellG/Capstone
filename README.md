### **What It Does**
The application is made to make Shopping in high volume stores more efficient. It takes a persons made list and reorganize list(in any order) and put it in a order based of proximity based of where you are Standing in the store. the application is most effective when started outside the store, this is because it will be able to suggest which entrance to use(for those Stores with multiple entrances) to best optimize your time.

### **Who is it for?**
The app is for anyone to use but is targeted at people who need to go shopping but are short on time. People who prefer time management above all else. The shoppers would'nt bother or ask anyone anything if they don't have to. People who end up overspending due to aimlessly searching the store. As well as people who travel a lot and are unfamiliar with where they are but still need to shop.
